# Graphic Visualization
The N-Body simulation is best experienced visually, ergo it needs to be rendered graphically. In order to do this we used `pyplot` ad `matplotlib.animation`, two widely used Python libraries. First we need to parse the file generated by the Exporter object, which contains the evolution of all particles positins over time. Then we can proceed at generating the animation of the simulation. \
**Warning**: make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed, namely `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas` and `ffmepg`. These are necessary in order to execute the file `viewer.py` locally. If you don't want to install them on your machine, you can upload the said file on Google Colab and run it using a remote machine. 

The steps are the following: \
1 - check the simulation parameters, namely the number of time instants and the number of objects in the simulation.
Open the file `viewer.py` and look for:
```python
# number of time instants
N = 336
# number of particles
N_part = 32

```
2 - make sure the file `test.part` generated by the example is present in this folder \
3 - move to the terminal and parse the input with:
```bash
python3 real_parser.py
```
4 - generate the graphic simulation with:
```bash
python3 viewer.py 
```
5 - check out the .mp4 file generated in the current folder. The result should be something like this: \
