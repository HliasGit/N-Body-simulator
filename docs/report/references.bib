abstract = {We develop serial and parallel versions of two programs. The first is the elementary algorithm for an n-body simulation, and the second is the sample sort algorithm. Our parallel versions use OpenMP, Pthreads, MPI, and CUDA. After developing basic implementations, we also develop more powerful implementations of the serial version and each parallel version. In closing we provide some guidance to choosing a parallel API.}
