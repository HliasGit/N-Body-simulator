# N-Body examples 
These examples reflect the history of the project development. We experimented different structures to describe the particles and the system, hence some examples may not be working anymore. We decided to keep them as an admonishment of our past mistakes and so that we remmeber all the work we did in the past. 

## Usage
Enter any example folder and follow these instructions to run the code:

``` bash
# create new directory for compilation and execution
$ mkdir build

# enter the directory
$ cd build

# generate make files with cmake 
$ cmake ..

# compile
$ make

# run the executable with
$ ./NameOfTheExecutable
```
